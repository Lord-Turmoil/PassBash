You can also take a look at my blog - [PassBash](http://www.tonys-studio.top/2023/01/18/PassBash/). :)

## What Is It?

PassBash, a.k.a. Pash, is a light-weight command-line password manager, using Tiny Encryption Algorithm to protect your data. And, again, developed with [tinyxml2](http://leethomason.github.io/tinyxml2/).

It provides you with management abilities to tidy your passwords in groups and items. Each password item is like a "file" in your computer, and you can put related passwords into one group, representing a folder. Of course, you can create groups in groups.

## How to Use It?

Just use it like Linux bash, but with fewer functions. Basically, I tried to make the meaning of commands in PassBash the same as what is Linux. You can always use help to check available commands.

Below is a simple example of the commands in PassBash.

```bash
.$ mkdir social
Group "social" created.
.$ cd social
./social$ touch qq
Password item "qq" created.
./social$ mod qq
------------------------------------------- Edit Mode -------------------------------------------
Use "help" for more information.

## What Is It?

PassBash, a.k.a. Pash, is a light-weight command-line password manager, using Tiny Encryption Algorithm to protect your data. And, again, developed with [tinyxml2](http://leethomason.github.io/tinyxml2/).

It provides you with management ability like folders and files. Each password item is like a "file" in your computer, and you can put related passwords into one group, representing a folder. Of course, you can create groups in groups.

## How to Use It?

Just use it like Linux bash, but with fewer functions. Basically, I tried to make the meaning of commands in PassBash the same as what is Linux. You can always use help to check available commands.
